Focus Phase (FP) is a **simple** yet **powerful** timer and **time tracker**. It is a command-line application written in Python and can be installed with one command.

FP has two timers: one for when you know for how long you are going to work (like a Pomodoro timer), and the other for when you don't know in advance for how long you are going to work. FP keeps a log of all your work in a csv file on your device. FP allows you to see statistics and graphs about your previous work also.
